/**
 * @title Base Proxy contract.
 * 
 * Adapted version of https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/blob/development/contracts/proxy/Proxy.sol 
 *
 * @notice The proxy performs delegated calls to the contract implementation
 * it is pointing to. This way upgradable contracts are possible on blockchain.
 *
 * Delegating proxy contracts are widely used for both upgradeability and gas
 * savings. These proxies rely on a logic contract (also known as implementation
 * contract or master copy) that is called using delegatecall. This allows
 * proxies to keep a persistent state (storage and balance) while the code is
 * delegated to the logic contract.
 *
 * Proxy contract is meant to be inherited and its internal functions
 * _setImplementation and _setOwner to be called when upgrades become
 * neccessary.
 *
 * The loan token (iToken) contract as well as the protocol contract act as
 * proxies, delegating all calls to underlying contracts. Therefore, if you
 * want to interact with them using web3, you need to use the ABIs from the
 * contracts containing the actual logic or the interface contract.
 *   ABI for LoanToken contracts: LoanTokenLogicStandard
 *   ABI for Protocol contract: ISovryn
 *
 * @dev UpgradableProxy is the contract that inherits Proxy and wraps these
 * functions.
 * */
