 * @title Upgradable Proxy contract.

 * Adapted version of https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/blob/development/contracts/proxy/UpgradableProxy.sol
 * 
 * @notice A disadvantage of the immutable ledger is that nobody can change the
 * source code of a smart contract after itâ€™s been deployed. In order to fix
 * bugs or introduce new features, smart contracts need to be upgradable somehow.
 *
 * Although it is not possible to upgrade the code of an already deployed smart
 * contract, it is possible to set-up a proxy contract architecture that will
 * allow to use new deployed contracts as if the main logic had been upgraded.
 *
 * A proxy architecture pattern is such that all message calls go through a
 * Proxy contract that will redirect them to the latest deployed contract logic.
 * To upgrade, a new version of the contract is deployed, and the Proxy is
 * updated to reference the new contract address.
 * */
