## Fees.redemptionRate() method

Calculate the current redemption rate.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
redemptionRate(redeemedFractionOfSupply?: Decimalish, when?: Date): Decimal;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  redeemedFractionOfSupply | [Decimalish](./lib-base.decimalish.md) | The amount of ZUSD being redeemed divided by the total supply. |
|  when | Date | Optional timestamp that can be used to calculate what the redemption rate would decay to at a point of time in the future. |

<b>Returns:</b>

[Decimal](./lib-base.decimal.md)

## Remarks

By default, the fee is calculated at the time of the latest block. This can be overridden using the `when` parameter.

Unlike the borrowing rate, the redemption rate depends on the amount being redeemed. To be more precise, it depends on the fraction of the redeemed amount compared to the total ZUSD supply, which must be passed as a parameter.

To calculate the redemption fee in ZUSD, multiply the redeemed ZUSD amount with the redemption rate.

## Example


```typescript
const fees = await zero.getFees();
const total = await zero.getTotal();

const redeemedZUSDAmount = Decimal.from(100);
const redeemedFractionOfSupply = redeemedZUSDAmount.div(total.debt);
const redemptionRate = fees.redemptionRate(redeemedFractionOfSupply);
const redemptionFeeZUSD = redemptionRate.mul(redeemedZUSDAmount);

```
